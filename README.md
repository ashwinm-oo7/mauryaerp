# Updated saved memory
Great! Let's now update both the Header and MenuRegistration components to follow your described logic, and ensure entries go to the saberpmenu MongoDB collection based on the type:

✅ Logic Summary

| Type    | `bname`   | `tablename` | `MenuName` | `FormType` | Stored In    |
| ------- | --------- | ----------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| Menu    | ✅ present | ❌ blank     | ❌ blank    | ✅ M/T/R/I  | `saberpmenu` |
| Submenu | ✅ present | ❌ blank     | ✅ present  | ✅ M/T/R/I  | `saberpmenu` |
| Form    | ✅ present | ✅ present   | ❌ blank    | ✅ M/T/R/I  | `saberpmenu` |

Master
 ├── Production (submenu)
 │    └── Yarn Setup (form)
 └── Logistics (submenu)
      └── Challan Entry (form)

| Case | `MenuName` | `ParentSubmenuName` | `tablename` | Meaning                                    |
| ---- | ---------- | ------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| ✅ A  | ✅ Yes      | ❌ No                | ✅ Yes       | Form is directly under a Submenu in a Menu |
| ✅ B  | ✅ Yes      | ✅ Yes               | ✅ Yes       | Form is inside a Nested Submenu            |
| ✅ C  | ✅ Yes      | ❌ No                | ❌ No        | Submenu under Menu                         |
| ✅ D  | ✅ Yes      | ✅ Yes               | ❌ No        | Nested Submenu under another Submenu       |
| ✅ E  | ❌ No       | ❌ No                | ✅ Yes       | Form directly under Menu (no submenu)   
| ✅ F  | ✅ Yes      | ❌ No                |  ❌ No       | Menu only    

✅ Menu Structure:
Menu
├── Submenu
│   ├── Form(s)
│
├── Direct Form(s)

1) And you want to ensure it supports nesting like:
Menu
├── Submenu
│   ├── Submenu1
│   │   └── Form1
│   └── Form2

## ✅ Plan: How to Do It the Dynamic Way
Extend your controls system:

Add a new control type called "grid" or "lineitems" in the controls array.

That control has a subControls property — which is an array of fields (just like your top controls).

Render a custom GridDynamicControl component for that.

### ✅ Step 1: Example Data in controls
Here’s what an entry in formData.controls could look like for the line item grid:

```
{
  id: "grid1",
  controlType: "grid",
  label: "LineItems",
  subControls: [
    { label: "Product", controlType: "dropdown", options: ["P1", "P2"], required: true },
    { label: "Rate", controlType: "input", dataType: "decimal", required: true },
    { label: "Qty", controlType: "input", dataType: "int", required: true }
  ]
}
```
## ✅ Defense-in-Depth (Layer-by-Layer Security)
### Your architecture follows the principle of least privilege + multi-layer security:

| Layer                          | Implemented                             | Description                                   |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Frontend visibility gating** | ✅ `power`, `userAccess`, route wrappers | Prevents normal users from seeing admin tools |
| **Frontend route enforcement** | ✅ `PrivateRoute`, `AdminRoute`          | Logical access blocking via routing           |
| **Token-based authentication** | ✅ `verifyToken`                         | Stateless and secure                          |
| **Role-based authorization**   | ✅ `isAdmin` middleware                  | Proper privilege checks                       |
| **JWT validation**             | ✅ Server-side, uses secret key          | Cannot be forged                              |
| **Token decoding in React**    | ✅ `jwtDecode` for UI usage only         | Not used for security decisions               |


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
